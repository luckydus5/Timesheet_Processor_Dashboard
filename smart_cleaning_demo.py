üß† SMART CLEANING ALGORITHM:
============================

Step 1: Group entries by Employee + Date
Step 2: Separate check-ins and check-outs
Step 3: Apply cleaning rules:

FOR CHECK-INS (OverTime In, C/In, CheckIn, etc.):
   ‚Üí Keep EARLIEST time (06:42:59)
   ‚Üí Remove all others (07:40:22)

FOR CHECK-OUTS (OverTime Out, C/Out, CheckOut, etc.):
   ‚Üí Keep LATEST time (17:04:26)
   ‚Üí Remove all others (if any)

Step 4: Provide detailed cleaning log
Step 5: Allow user to download removed entries for review

BENEFITS:
=========
‚úÖ Handles ANY number of multiple entries per day
‚úÖ Works with ANY status names (OverTime In/Out, C/In/Out, CheckIn/Out, etc.)
‚úÖ Preserves original data with detailed logging
‚úÖ Gives user full control and transparency
‚úÖ Prevents "unmatched entry" warnings
‚úÖ Ensures clean, accurate shift calculations

   - Displays cleaning statistics
   - Employee-by-employee breakdown

2. üì• DOWNLOADABLE LOGS:
   - Cleaning log with all removed entries
   - Unmatched entries report (if any remain)
   - Original vs cleaned data comparison

3. üîç EXPANDABLE DETAILS:

   - Review unmatched entries with explanations

4. ‚ö†Ô∏è SMART WARNINGS:
   - Flags unusual patterns

üîß IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
========================

The enhanced system now:

1. AUTOMATICALLY handles your exact scenario
2. PREVENTS unmatched entry warnings
3. PROVIDES full transparency of all actions taken
4. ALLOWS you to review and download removed entries
5. WORKS with any combination of status names

When you run the dashboard now, instead of seeing:
‚ùå "‚ö†Ô∏è Unmatched check-in: BAKOMEZA GIDEON on 2025-11-08 at 06:42:59"

You'll see:
‚úÖ "üßπ DATA CLEANING PERFORMED - 1 entries removed"
‚úÖ "‚úÖ Processed 1 shift pairs successfully" 
‚úÖ Clean consolidated timesheet with proper shift calculation

No more manual intervention needed for common multiple entry scenarios! üéâ
